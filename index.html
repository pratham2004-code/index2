    not drinkable <br>
    Because there is some water in the form ice caps<br>
glaciers,making it <br>
inaccessible for human consumption.Due to this <br>
only a very small<br>
of water is easily accessible. It's is estimated as less than 1%<br>

        Water Quality:
    </h3>
    <p>  EPI "Enviromental Performance Index" rates score out of 100 to all the countries according to there water quality.Better the quality of water higher the score.  </p>
<p class="h">There are total 9 countries on the no.1 position  having  the score of 100 ,<br>Austria, Finland, Greece,<br> Iceland, Ireland, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom are tied for the top spot</p>
<p class="h">And if we talk about INDIA,India is very below on the list<br>
with the score of 19.5.<br>
And with the lowest score is Niger, and the most polluted river in the world is in India which is the Ganga

<h4>Effects of the water pollution in the world: </h4>
<p class="h">We all know water is life. If we will not save water than surely there is no life.</p>
<p class="i">Food chain disruption:</p>
<p class="h">
    When eutrophication causes certain species to dwindle or die out, that can have a knock-on effect on the predators which feed upon <br>them, thus causing shockwaves further up the food chain.<br> Meanwhile, consumption and absorption of polluted water by marine and aquatic organisms is capable of causing<br> damage to their internal organs. When they are <br>later consumed by larger species, the food chain can become compromised and contaminated,<br> eventually affecting the human race indirectly.

<p class="i">Affects aquatic life:</p>
<p class="h">Water contamination has a significant impact on aquatic life. It affects their metabolism and behaviour, as well as causing<br> disease and death. Dioxin is a toxin that causes a variety<br> of issues, ranging from reproductive issues to uncontrolled cell development and cancer. This chemical<br> accumulates in fish, poultry, and meat. Chemicals like<br> these make their way up the food chain before entering the human body.</p>
