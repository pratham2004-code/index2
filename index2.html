        <h1>Effects of the water pollution in the world: </h1>
<p class="h">We all know water is life. If we will not save water than surely there is no life.</p>
<p class="i">Food chain disruption:</p>
<p class="h">
    When eutrophication causes certain species to dwindle or die out, that can have a knock-on effect on the predators which feed upon <br>them, thus causing shockwaves further up the food chain.<br> Meanwhile, consumption and absorption of polluted water by marine and aquatic organisms is capable of causing<br> damage to their internal organs. When they are <br>later consumed by larger species, the food chain can become compromised and contaminated,<br> eventually affecting the human race indirectly.

<p class="i">Affects aquatic life:</p>
<p class="h">Water contamination has a significant impact on aquatic life. It affects their metabolism and behaviour, as well as causing<br> disease and death. Dioxin is a toxin that causes a variety<br> of issues, ranging from reproductive issues to uncontrolled cell development and cancer. This chemical<br> accumulates in fish, poultry, and meat. Chemicals like<br> these make their way up the food chain before entering the human body.</p>

    Contaminated water:
</p>
<p class="h">
    The WHO estimates that about 2 billion people have no option but to drink water contaminated by excrement, exposing them to diseases such as cholera, hepatitis etc<br>Also, animals fall prey to a variety of<br> diseases due to drinking polluted water. Spoiling Natural beauty.<br>If drinking water supplies cannot meet the demand, people will be forced to consume unsafe<br> sources of drinking water.

    Economic Impacts
</p>
<p class="h">The effects of water pollution are not just related to human and environmental health, either. Contaminated water supplies must go through a rigorous treatment<br> process before they can become potable or suitable for<br> irrigation, washing or swimming in. This entails a financial price tag that is prohibitive on human progress. Meanwhile, another <br>economic impact engendered by water pollution is<br> the loss of revenue experienced by the tourism industry in certain parts of the world.</p>
