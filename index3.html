    <p class="a">Industarial waste:</p>
    <p class="b">Water pollution has many sources. The most polluting of them are the city sewage and industrial waste discharged into the rivers.<br> Industrial waste is defined as waste<br> generated by manufacturing or industrial processes. The types of industrial waste generated include cafeteria garbage,<br> dirt and gravel, masonry and concrete, scrap metals,<br> trash, oil, solvents, chemicals, weed grass and trees, wood and scrap lumber, and similar wastes.<br> Industrial solid waste - which may be <br>solid, liquid or gases held in containers - is divided into hazardous and non-hazardous waste. Hazardous waste may result from manufacturing or other industrial processes.<br> Certain commercial products such as cleaning fluids,<br> paints or pesticides discarded by commercial establishments or individuals can also be defined as hazardous waste.<br> Non-hazardous industrial wastes are those that<br> do not meet the EPA's definition of hazardous waste - and are not municipal waste. Industrial waste has been a problem since the industrial revolution.<br> Industrial waste may be toxic, ignitable,<br> corrosive or reactive. If improperly managed, this waste can pose dangerous health and environmental consequences.</p>

    <p class="a">Marine Dumping and Plastic pollution in the sea:</p>
    <p class="b">Many animals that live on or in the sea consume flotsam by mistake, as it often looks similar to their natural prey. Overall,<br> 1288 marine species are known to ingest<br> plastic debris, with fish making up the largest fraction. Bulky plastic debris may become permanently lodged<br> in the digestive tracts of these animals,<br> blocking the passage of food and causing death through starvation or infection.<br>Tiny floating plastic particles also resemble zooplankton,<br> which can lead filter feeders to consume them and cause them to enter the ocean food chain.<br> In addition, plastic in the marine environment that<br> contaminates the food chain can have repercussions on the viability of fish and shellfish species.</p>

<p class="a">Oil Pollution</p>
<p class="b">One of the worst types of water pollution is oil pollution. This is because the oil spills from tankers and ships tend to create a thick layer above the water in seas or oceans.<br> And since oil doesn’t dissolve, the sludge stays foreverBig spills may dominate headlines,<br> but consumers account for the vast majority of oil pollution in our seas, including oil and gasoline that drips from millions of cars and trucks every day.<br> Moreover, nearly half of the estimated 1 million tons<br> of oil that makes its way into marine environments each year comes not from tanker spills but from <br>land-based sources such as factories, farms, and cities. <br>At sea, tanker spills account for about 10 percent of the oil in waters around the world, while regular operations of the shipping industry—through both legal and illegal discharges—contribute about one-third.<br> Oil is also naturally released from under the<br> ocean floor through fractures known as seeps..</p>

<p class="a">Radioactive waste:</p>
<p class="b">
    Radioactive waste is any pollution that emits radiation beyond what is naturally released by the environment. It’s generated by uranium mining, nuclear power plants,<br> and the production and testing of military weapons,<br> as well as by universities and hospitals that use radioactive materials for research and medicine. Radioactive waste can persist in the environment for thousands <br>of years, making disposal a major challenge.<br> Consider the decommissioned Hanford nuclear weapons production site in Washington, where the cleanup of 56 million gallons<br> of radioactive waste is expected to cost more than $100 billion and last through 2060. <br>Accidentally released or improperly disposed of contaminants threaten groundwater, surface water, and marine resources.
